# My-Greatest-Fear.md
**My greatest fear is about our future generation. I  worry they will have to live in a world that is far more broken than the one we are already living in.**
### Climate
Seeing how we are constantly cutting down trees,how each person leaves behind a massive carbon footprint,how we waste food and water without any second thought or guilt,
and build endless skyscrapers leaving no space for nature. We are a deeply unsustainable future.

They may have to live in a world that has no fresh water. The air they will breathe in will be even more polluted. Icebergs will melt;
drowning costlines slowly and silently. That will cost people their homes, flooding will also likely affect buisnesses and tourism in costal cities.
In shelters, people might face health issues. Temeperatures will raise, and maybe unlivble cities will become the new norm.

#### So... can we do something to change it ?
Maybe.

If each of us plants at least twelve trees a year. Think twice before wasting water, packing up lefovers insted of throwing it. Because rotting food in landfields realease mathane; which is
even more potent than carbon dioxide. And maybe make sure we turn the light off when it's not needed. The more energy we consume,
the more prressurre we put on power plants to produce electricity;causing us higher carbon footprints.

Just keep the fact in mind that, **we are not the final civilaztion to live on this planet.** There are 4/5 babies being born each socond; that's about 385,000 child each day.

**Let's not fail them before they even begin.**
